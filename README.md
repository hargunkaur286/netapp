## Problem Statement

 - The financial technology (FinTech) industry is reshaping financial services with innovations such as mobile banking, digital payments, automated wealth management, and blockchain technology. 
 - Despite its rapid growth, there is a significant knowledge gap among the general population about FinTech concepts. A study by EY found that while 64% of digitally active consumers globally use FinTech services, many remain unaware of how to utilize these technologies effectively. 
 - The World Bank reports that around 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, highlighting a critical need for financial education to bridge this gap and promote financial inclusion. 
 - Traditional financial education methods are often inaccessible or ineffective. According to the OECD, only 38% of adults in major economies have basic financial literacy. 
 - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital financial service adoption, yet many users struggle to understand and trust these services, as reported by McKinsey. 
 - There is an urgent need for an engaging, interactive, and easily accessible platform that educates people about FinTech, fostering better financial decision-making and inclusion. 
 - Incorporating AI and data management can enhance learning experiences, providing personalized and efficient educational solutions. 
 - FinEdge aims to bridge this knowledge gap by offering interactive features, personalized learning paths, real-time assistance, and secure financial tracking, leveraging the latest 
   technologies to educate users effectively.
